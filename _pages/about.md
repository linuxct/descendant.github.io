<h2 align="center">About Descendant</h2>

<hr>

Descendant is an Android Custom ROM that aims to add useful tweaks over Google's Android AOSP 9.
Nothing fancy, straight AOSP plus some tweaks that per-my-idea should be shipped by default in any pure AOSP.

Founded and leaded by {% include icon-github.html username="Dil3mm4" %}, Descendant it's an open-source project that (at the moment) targets Treble enabled devices.

I'm open to any contribution. 

You can head to the sources at {% include icon-github.html username="Descendant" %} 

Also, do mind that this project requires a lot of efforts, sleepless nights and strenuous perseverance.

You may have noticed that I'm not monetizing the downloads with ADS services. 

<p>If you appreciate my ROM, please consider to donate via <img src="/assets/img/paypal.png" style="width: 11%"> at dil3mm4.dev@gmail.com.</p>
