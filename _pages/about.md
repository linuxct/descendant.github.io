<h2 align="center">About Descendant</h2>

<hr>

Descendant is a different take on Android that aims to revolutionize Google's Android AOSP experience.

Founded in 2018, leaded by {% include icon-github.html username="Dil3mm4" %}, Descendant it's an OS that can be installed on various platforms.

I'm open to any contribution. 

You can head to the sources at {% include icon-github.html username="Descendant" %} 

Also, do mind that this project requires a lot of efforts, sleepless nights and strenuous perseverance.

You may have noticed that I'm not monetizing the downloads with ADS services.
