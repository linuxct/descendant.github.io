### Introducing Descendant's new UI:

* QS Panel has been redesigned and now includes Descendant's QuickView. 

     Descendant's QuickView is a peek view that holds the most useful informations in the QS Panel which includes:
     Clock, date, carrier, battery estimates.
     Every element of this view is tappable and will redirect you accordingly to:
     Your default clock app;
     Your default calendar;
     Carrier/data settings; 
     Battery fragment.


* Notifications UI it's now centered. 

* General notfications UI improvements. 

* Volume Slider has been redesigned (winks at MIUI). 

* Clear all text has been replaced with a button.

* Q Clock impovements.

* Charging animations has been refreshed.

* More icons have been added in Settings preferences.

* Settings now always shows title, even on main dashboard.

* Black theme it's now bi-tonal.

### Features:

  Available in Settings -> Apps and notifications -> Notifications 
  It's a feature that changes the notification title alignment (needs reboot).
