Since you may have noticed that no release happened from Descendant OneDotFive and that a lot of you wondered if we went dead or what, here I'm writing this couple of lines. 

We're more than alive, but we needed to regroup ideas, priorities and whatsoever. 

There will be huge changes over OneDotSix release (so huge that I'm probably about to call that TwoDotZero), that should enhance your overall experience, performance and UI. 

I don't have a release date for you. 
But I can promise that from the next release on we'll have a monthly release schedule between 5th-10th.

That said, brace brace brace, this is going to be a Descendant year.

Oh.. meanwhile you wait for the release.. here's what the battery settings looks alike now.
