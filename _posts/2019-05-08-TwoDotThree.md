A special thanks goes to Roger T., that provided me a new awesome logo. 

On a side note, I'd like to send out a shout to <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=9196003">@arnaud42</a>, having a bit of probs with Google with his awesome Kiwi Browser that we're actually shipping.

Oh, and, another thing. 
I'll probably not merge any other major change/feature to Descendant except security patches and a bit of fine tuning on what's available already. 
Descendant has already a lot of features inherited and I'm more than satisfied with them.

Without further ado, head over to the <a href="https://descendant.me/downloads/">Downloads</a> page!
