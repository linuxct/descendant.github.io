A year has gone by and we have pushed ourselves to the limit to offer our very best product, with bleeding edge technology and never seen before features, as well as offering the userbase a whole different take on Android UI & UX. 
We're sad to say that Descendant isn't just capable to keep up with this for the upcoming Android Q release with our current means, so we are calling it a day.

Still, we'd thank you all for the feedback provided up till now, we're very proud of what we have achieved. 

Sayonara, Descendants.
